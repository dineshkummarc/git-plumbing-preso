Gitting Down to the Plumbing
============================

Most of the Ruby community uses Git now, but there is a lot more to Git 
than just an Version Control System. If you look past the porcelain 
commands to the plumbing commands of Git, you can use it as a sort of 
key-value system to store all kinds of data easily with built in 
cryptographic integrity, compression and incrementally updating distribution
mechanisms. This talk will introduce some of the Git plumbing commands 
that you probably have never heard of that are normally wrapped by the 
higher level Git commands, and we will show how to use the Ruby-Git 
library to script interesting functionality with them. You will leave 
with a better understanding of how Git works and maybe with some ideas 
of how to use Git for purposes other than a VCS.
